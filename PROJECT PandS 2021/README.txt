The Irish Dataset

This dataset was produced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher in his research paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'.

The dataset consisty of 50 records for each of the 3 irish spicies (150 records in total): 
	- Iris setosa
	- Iris virginica
	- Iris versicolor

For each species 4 features were collected: 
	- Sepals lenght (cm)
	- Sepals width (cm)
	- Petals lenght (cm)
	- Petals width (cm)

Over the years, the Iris flower data set has become a classic test case for numerous statistical and data analysis techniques.

Using Python, we will analyze this data and present it in an intellegible way.
