The Irish Dataset

This dataset was produced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher in his research paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'.

The dataset consisty of 50 records for each of the 3 irish spicies (150 records/observations in total): 
	- Iris setosa
	- Iris virginica
	- Iris versicolor

For each species 4 features were collected: 
	- Sepals lenght (cm)
	- Sepals width (cm)
	- Petals lenght (cm)
	- Petals width (cm)

Over the years, the Iris flower data set has become a classic test case for numerous statistical and data analysis techniques.

Using Python, we will analyze this data and present it in an intellegible way. 


First the entire data set is analyzed. Python is used to create a histogram of the Iris petals and sepals attributes collected by Fisher.
	- Histogram of Petal Width
	- Histogram of Petal Length	
	- Histogram of Sepal Width
	- Histogram of Sepal Length
These histogram are the occasion to observe how the data points are distributed with respect to frequency.

Diving down further into the details, the same analysis is carried out on the flower type/spiecies level. 
For each species, similar histograms are generated through Python.
