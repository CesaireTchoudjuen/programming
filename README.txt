#PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING

### by Cesaire Tchoudjuen - 2021H1

## This is the repository for the programming and scripting course from Galway Mayo IT with Andrew Beatty

In this repository, code will be uploaded to demonstrate:
* Work on weekly labs
* Work on weekly task (problem sheet)

### Weekly Lab

For each week's class, code is uploaded as I follow along the lecturer's demonstration. Labs and homework can also be found here.

### Weekly Tasks

For the first 8 classes, a problem (weekly task) was proposed to the student.
